  # unit tests for delete
  # Deletes a download session. This removes the session and all information associated with it. &lt;p&gt; Removing a download session leaves any current transfers for that session in an indeterminate state (there is no guarantee that the transfers will be able to complete). However there will no longer be a means of inspecting the status of those downloads except by seeing the effect on the library item. &lt;p&gt; Download sessions for which there is no download activity or which are complete will automatically be expired and then deleted after a period of time.
  # @param download_session_id Identifier of the download session to be deleted.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @return [nil]
  describe 'delete test' do
    it 'should work' do

  # unit tests for fail
  # Terminates the download session with a client specified error message. &lt;p&gt; This is useful in transmitting client side failures (for example, not being able to download a file) to the server side.
  # @param download_session_id Identifier of the download session to fail.
  # @param content_library_item_download_session_fail 
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters

  # unit tests for get
  # Gets the download session with the specified identifier, including the most up-to-date status information for the session.

  # unit tests for keep_alive
  # Keeps a download session alive. This operation is allowed only if the session is in the {@link DownloadSessionModel.State#ACTIVE} state. &lt;p&gt; If there is no activity for a download session for a certain period of time, the download session will expire. The download session expiration timeout is configurable in the Content Library Service system configuration. The default is five minutes. Invoking this {@term operation} enables a client to specifically extend the lifetime of an active download session.
  # @param download_session_id Identifier of the download session whose lifetime should be extended.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [ContentLibraryItemDownloadSessionKeepAlive] :content_library_item_download_session_keep_alive

  # unit tests for list
  # Lists the identifiers of the download sessions created by the calling user. Optionally may filter by library item.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :library_item_id Library item identifier on which to filter results.
  # @return [ContentLibraryItemDownloadSessionListResult]
