  # unit tests for create
  # Creates a new subscribed library. &lt;p&gt; Once created, the subscribed library will be empty. If the {@link LibraryModel#subscriptionInfo} property is set, the Content Library Service will attempt to synchronize to the remote source. This is an asynchronous operation so the content of the published library may not immediately appear.

  # unit tests for delete
  # Deletes the specified subscribed library. &lt;p&gt; Deleting a subscribed library will remove the entry immediately and begin an asynchronous task to remove all cached content for the library. If the asynchronous task fails, file content may remain on the storage backing. This content will require manual removal.

  # unit tests for evict
  # Evicts the cached content of an on-demand subscribed library. &lt;p&gt; This {@term operation} allows the cached content of a subscribed library to be removed to free up storage capacity. This {@term operation} will only work when a subscribed library is synchronized on-demand.

  # unit tests for sync
  # Forces the synchronization of the subscribed library. &lt;p&gt; Synchronizing a subscribed library forcefully with this {@term operation} will perform the same synchronization behavior as would run periodically for the library. The {@link SubscriptionInfo#onDemand} setting is respected. Calling this {@term operation} on a library that is already in the process of synchronizing will have no effect.

  # Updates the properties of a subscribed library. &lt;p&gt; This is an incremental update to the subscribed library. {@term Fields} that are {@term unset} in the update specification will be left unchanged.
  # @param library_id Identifier of the subscribed library to update.
