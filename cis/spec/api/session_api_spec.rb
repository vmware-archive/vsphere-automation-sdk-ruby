  # Creates a session with the API. This is the equivalent of login. This operation exchanges user credentials supplied in the security context for a session identifier that is to be used for authenticating subsequent calls. To authenticate subsequent calls clients are expected to include the session key.

  # unit tests for get
  # Returns information about the current session. This operation expects a valid session identifier to be supplied.   A side effect of invoking this operation may be a change to the session&#39;s last accessed time to the current time if this is supported by the session implementation. Invoking any other operation in the API will also update the session&#39;s last accessed time.    This API is meant to serve the needs of various front end projects that may want to display the name of the user. Examples of this include various web based user interfaces and logging facilities.
