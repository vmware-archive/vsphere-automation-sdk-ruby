  # @option opts [Array<String>] :filter_folders Identifiers of folders that can match the filter. If unset or empty, folders with any identifier match the filter. When clients pass a value of this structure as a parameter, the field must contain identifiers for the resource type: Folder. When operations return a value of this structure as a result, the field will contain identifiers for the resource type: Folder.

  # @option opts [String] :filter_type The Folder.Type enumerated type defines the type of a vCenter Server folder. The type of a folder determines what what kinds of children can be contained in the folder.
  # @option opts [Array<String>] :filter_parent_folders Folders that must contain the folder for the folder to match the filter. If unset or empty, folder in any folder match the filter. When clients pass a value of this structure as a parameter, the field must contain identifiers for the resource type: Folder. When operations return a value of this structure as a result, the field will contain identifiers for the resource type: Folder.
  # @option opts [Array<String>] :filter_datacenters Datacenters that must contain the folder for the folder to match the filter. If unset or empty, folder in any datacenter match the filter. When clients pass a value of this structure as a parameter, the field must contain identifiers for the resource type: Datacenter.
