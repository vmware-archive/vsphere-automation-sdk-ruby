  # unit tests for create
  # Creates a library item in content library from a virtual machine or virtual appliance. &lt;p&gt; This {@term operation} creates a library item in content library whose content is an OVF package derived from a source virtual machine or virtual appliance, using the supplied create specification. The OVF package may be stored as in a newly created library item or in an in an existing library item. For an existing library item whose content is updated by this {@term operation}, the original content is overwritten. &lt;/p&gt;

  # Queries an OVF package stored in content library to retrieve information to use when deploying the package. See {@link #deploy}. &lt;p&gt; This {@term operation} retrieves information from the descriptor of the OVF package stored in the library item specified by {@param.name ovfLibraryItemId}.
