When operations return a value of this structure as a result, the field will contain identifiers for the resource type: Network.

  # @option opts [Array<String>] :filter_folders Folders that must contain the network for the network to match the filter. If unset or empty, networks in any folder match the filter. When clients pass a value of this structure as a parameter, the field must contain identifiers for the resource type: Folder. When operations return a value of this structure as a result, the field will contain identifiers for the resource type: Folder.
